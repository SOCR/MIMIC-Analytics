Overview
========

The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care ([MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/)) is a data set developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lab for Computational Physiology (MIT-LCP) which contains de-identified healthcare data from more than 40,000 intensive care unit (ICU) patients over the years 2001-2012 (Johnson et al., 2016). It includes much of the information typically found in an electronic health record (EHR) including demographic information, diagnosis codes, procedures, lab values, vital signs, free-text clinical notes, and admission, discharge, and mortality information.

Resources
=========

* All [data](https://github.com/SOCR/MIMIC_Analytics/tree/master/data) used in this study is openly and publicly available from [Physionet](https://mimic.physionet.org/). Access requires [registration and signing of an appropriate data use agreement](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/).
* The [code directory](https://github.com/SOCR/MIMIC_Analytics/tree/master/code) contains the complete collection of R scripts used to preprocess, model, visualize, interrogate and understand the data.
* The [results](https://github.com/SOCR/MIMIC_Analytics/tree/master/results) folder includes some of the derived measures and result summaries.
